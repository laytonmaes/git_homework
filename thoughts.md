My first thought is that I'm realizing more an more that while helpful,
planning in excess brings me a ton of stress. i need to do it to what i deem an
acceptable amount.

I've also realized i need to do it. notes are also important.

I am gonna try to take notes a little better, they are a little scattered.
i am also gonna work on handwriting, cause dear lord has that atrophied.

My first thought is that I'm realizing more an more that while helpful,
planning in excess brings me a ton of stress. i need to do it to what i deem an
acceptable amount.

I've also realized i need to do it. notes are also important.

I am gonna try to take notes a little better, they are a little scattered.
i am also gonna work on handwriting, cause dear lord has that atrophied.

lastly for some shoutouts, my dad was super supportive, even rushing to help me
when github was being weird (to be fair was my fault)

also everyone here in class was great. all the loves to the team and students
